The assignment includes the following:

    Create a GitHub repository
    Create a basic React App using create-react app or your own custom webpack
    Create a basic Express.js REST api with a single GET endpoint that outputs the attached state JSON feed as a response
    Consume this API endpoint within the React front end you build
    Create a map component using the attached map SVG
    Create a selection box that contains the following input items
        0-250
        250-500
        500-1000
        1000+

    When the user selects the different values, the component should update and highlight the states that fall into that range of visits using the fill color #F59200. So, for example, if you select 0-250 then you should only highlight states that have between 0-250 visits. 

Below is a wireframe of what the map component and page should look like.

As a helpful hint, you may notice that the SVG file I attached has different paths for the different states and that the two character state code is in the class name of the path.
